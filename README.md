# Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Vijay Kumar**, a student at **IIT Guwahati** based in **India**.

I love building **any interesting projects** that spark curiosity and challenge my limits.  
If something catches my attention, I’ll probably start building it right away. 🚀

My main tech stack is **MERN**, and I’m always experimenting with new ideas and learning something new every day.

One of my favorite projects is **Zcoder** — check it out in my pinned repositories!

I’ve built **25+ public repositories** (and more in progress 👀).
